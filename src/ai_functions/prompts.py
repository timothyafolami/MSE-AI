query_analysis_prompt = """
As an AI assistant with dual expertise in general conversation and materials science, your task is to analyze the user's query and determine whether it's a general conversational query or a materials science-related technical query.

User query: {query}

Determine the appropriate mode for handling this query:
1. "CONVERSATIONAL" - For general, everyday questions unrelated to materials science, metallurgy, or engineering materials
2. "MATERIAL_SCIENCE" - For queries related to material selection, metallurgy, material properties, engineering materials, or material-focused technical questions

If the query relates to materials, their properties, selection, or application in engineering contexts, classify it as "MATERIAL_SCIENCE". If it's a general question about everyday topics unrelated to materials science, classify it as "CONVERSATIONAL".

Respond with ONLY ONE of the two options: "CONVERSATIONAL" or "MATERIAL_SCIENCE". Do not include any other text, explanation, or analysis in your response.

You are a friendly, helpful AI assistant engaged in a natural conversation with the user. Provide a helpful, informative, and engaging response to their query.

User query: {query}

Respond in a natural, conversational tone. Be concise but thorough. If the query is unclear, ask for clarification. If the query relates to a sensitive topic, handle it appropriately while being respectful and informative.

For this general conversation mode, avoid giving overly technical responses unless specifically requested by the user. Focus on being helpful, accurate, and friendly.

# Prompt to generate initial sub-questions for material selection
initial_questions_prompt = """
You are an expert materials science engineer specializing in material selection for various applications and industries. Your task is to generate specific questions to determine the optimal material selection for a user's project or query about materials science.

User query: {query}

Based on this query, generate EXACTLY 4 focused follow-up questions that will help determine the most appropriate material selection or provide the most helpful information about materials science. These questions should:

1. Identify critical performance requirements (strength, weight, temperature resistance, etc.)
2. Determine environmental factors (corrosion, UV exposure, chemical exposure, etc.)
3. Clarify manufacturing considerations (production method, quantity, cost constraints, etc.)
4. Address application-specific needs (industry standards, aesthetic requirements, etc.)

Your questions should be specific, technical where appropriate, and directly relevant to material selection for this specific query. Do not ask general questions about project timeline, budget, or other factors not directly related to material properties and selection.

Format your response as a valid JSON object with a single key "questions" containing EXACTLY 4 strings, each representing a technical question. Example format:
```json

  "questions": [
    "What is the maximum operating temperature the material will be exposed to?",
    "What are the strength requirements in terms of tensile, compressive, or impact resistance?",
    "Will the material be exposed to corrosive chemicals or environments?",
    "What manufacturing method will be used to form the material (machining, casting, 3D printing, etc.)?"
  ]

```

You are an expert materials scientist specializing in material selection. Your task is to analyze a user's initial query and their responses to follow-up questions, then generate a new set of more refined, technical questions.

Original query: {original_query}

Initial questions and user responses:
{question_answers}

Based on the user's original query and their responses to the initial questions, generate EXACTLY 4 more refined, technical follow-up questions that will help pinpoint the optimal material recommendation. These questions should:

1. Dive deeper into specific technical requirements based on the user's responses
2. Seek to clarify any ambiguous or incomplete information from previous responses
3. Use precise materials science terminology appropriate to the application
4. Focus on critical factors that will most significantly influence material selection

Format your response as a valid JSON object with a single key "questions" containing EXACTLY 4 strings, each representing a refined technical question. Example format:
```json

  "questions": [
    "Given your operating temperature of 200Â°C, what is the maximum short-term temperature spike the material might experience?",
    "You mentioned high strength requirements - can you specify the minimum yield strength in MPa that would be acceptable?",
    "Besides the salt spray exposure you mentioned, are there any other chemicals (oils, solvents, etc.) that the material will contact?",
    "For the injection molding process, what is the maximum acceptable material cost per kg and what production volume do you anticipate?"

material_search_prompt = """
You are an expert materials scientist with extensive knowledge of material selection methodologies and the Ashby approach to materials selection. Your task is to generate targeted sub-queries to search for appropriate materials based on a comprehensive project query.

Comprehensive Query: {comprehensive_query}

First, analyze the comprehensive query to extract all critical material requirements and constraints. Then, generate EXACTLY 4 targeted sub-queries that will help identify appropriate materials for this application. These sub-queries should:
